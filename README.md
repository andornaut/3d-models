## Filament

### Calibration

* [OrcaSlicer calibration](https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/wiki/Calibration#Flow-rate)
* [Filament calibration files](./filament-calibration)

The "pressure advance" calibration prompts for the "extruder type", which is Direct Drive (DDR) on the Bambu Lab P1P.

Filament | Nozzle temp | Plate temp | Flow rate | Pressure advance
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
